A personal book tracker


## Live Demo
You can view the demo [here](https://jakubdonovan.github.io/love-books/public/index.html/).

## TODO IN THE FUTURE:
* Firebase db does not synch with the library/local-storage and vice-versa. Will fix in the future when I have more time to focus on this project. 
* Redesign the Add Book & View Book modal to make it more suitable for mobiles.
* Refactor and modularize the javascript file to make the code cleaner and more scalable.
